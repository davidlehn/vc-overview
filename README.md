## VC Overview Document

This Note provides an overview of Verifiable Credentials Recommendations as published by the Verifiable Credentials Working Group at the W3D.

We encourage contributions meeting the
[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). While we prefer the creation of
issues and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions also occur on the
[public-vc-wg](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/) mailing list.

# Process Overview for VC Data Model Pull Requests
1. Anyone can open a PR on the repository.
2. Once a PR is opened, it will be reviewed by the Editors and other WG
   Members.
3. The W3C CCG is automatically notified of PRs as they are raised and
   discussed.
4. PRs are usually merged in 7 days if there is adequate review and consensus,
   as determined by the Chairs and Editors.

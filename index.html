          Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. 
          The family of Recommendations for Verifiable Credentials, described in this overview document, provide a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document provides a non-normative high-level overview of W3C’s Verifiable Credentials and serves as a roadmap for the documents that define, describe, and secure these credentials.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>High level overview</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="#overall"></a> provides and overview of the main building blocks of Verifiable Credentials, including their (normative) dependencies.
        The [[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]] specification, which defines the core concepts that all other specifications depend on, plays a central role.
        Applications express their specific credentials using a serialization of this data model in, for example, JSON.
      </p>

      <p>
        Credentials can be secured using two different mechanisms: [=enveloping proofs=] or [=embedded proofs=].
        In both cases, a proof secures a credential by cryptographic means (for example, digital signatures), which can be
        verified by a “verifier” (for example, the receiver of the credential).
        In the enveloping case the proof wraps the credential,  whereas a embedded proofs are included in the serialization of the credential itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        A family of enveloping proofs is defined in the [[[VC-JOSE-COSE]]] [[VC-JOSE-COSE]] document, relying on technologies defined by the IETF.
        They are based on JSON Object Signing and Encryption (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/">JOSE</a>), Selective Disclosure for JWTs [[SD-JWT]], or CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [[RFC9052]]. 
        Other types of embedded proofs may be specified by the community.
      </p>

      <p>
        The general structure for embedded proofs is defined in a separate [[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification.
        The Working Group also defines three instantiations of this general structure in the forms of three “cryptosuites”: [[[VC-DI-EDDSA]]] [[VC-DI-EDDSA]], [[[VC-DI-ECDSA]]] [[VC-DI-ECDSA]], and [[[VC-DI-BBS]]] [[VC-DI-BBS]]. Other cryptosuites may be specified by the community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Verifiable Credentials are serialized in JSON; it is important to trust that the structure may be interpreted in a consistent manner by all participants of verifiable credential ecosystem. 
        The [[[VC-JSON-SCHEMA]]] [[VC-JSON-SCHEMA]] defines how [[JSON-SCHEMA]] can be used for that purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the [[[VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST]]] [[VC-BITSTRING-STATUS-LIST]] specification defines a privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and high-performance mechanism for publishing status information such as suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials through use of bitstrings.

      <h2>Data model</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The Verifiable Credential specifications rely on an ecosystem consisting of entities that play different “roles”. 
          These roles are:  
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>issuer</dt>
          <dd>
            An entity that <em>creates</em> a credential, consisting of a series of claims related to the subject of a credential. 
            An example is a university that issues credentials for university degrees or that want to officially state that a person is indeed an alumni.
          </dd>

          <dt>holder</dt>
          <dd>
            An entity that <em>possesses</em> on or more credentials, and who can transmit <em>presentations</em> of those credentials to third parties. 
            An example may be the person who “holds“ his/her own educational degrees.
          </dd>

          <dt>verifier</dt>
          <dd>
            An entity that performs verification on a credential to check the validity, consistency, etc., of a credential.
            An example may be an employer who intends to check the validity of a university degree before deciding on the employment of a person.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          For a more detailed definition of these roles, see the relevant <a data-cite="VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0#ecosystem-overview">section</a> in the data model specification.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic structure</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Claims, properties</h4>
          <p>
            A core concept is that of “claims”: statements made about various entities, referred to as “subjects”. 
            Subjects may be the holders, issuers, or verifiers as listed above, but may also be any other person (e.g., the person holding a university degree), an animal, an abstract concepts, etc. 
            Claims are expressed using “properties” referring to “values”. 
          </p>

          <figure id="basic-structure">
            <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 80%;" src="diagrams/claim.svg" alt="subject has a property which

          </figure>

          <p>
            The [[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] specifies a number of standard properties. These include, for example, `credentialSubject`, `type`, `issuer`, `validFrom`, etc. Developers may define their own properties to be used for a specific kind of credentials, like a driving license, university degrees, or marriage certificates.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Verifiable Credentials</h4>

          <p>
            A credential is a set of one or more claims made by the same entity.
            Credentials might also include an identifier and metadata to describe properties of the credential, such as the issuer, the validity date and time period, a representative image, the revocation mechanism, and so on. 
            A <em>verifiable</em> credential is a set of claims and metadata that also includes verification mechanisms that cryptographically prove who issued it.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a more detailed description of abstract credentials, with examples, see the relevant <a
              data-cite="VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0#credentials">section</a> in the data model specification.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Verifiable Presentations</h4>
          <p>
            Enhancing privacy is a key design feature of Verifiable Credentials. 
            Therefore, it is important for entities using this technology to be able to express only the portions of their persona that are appropriate for a given situation.
            The expression of a subset of one's persona is called a <em>verifiable presentation</em>. 
            Examples of different personas include a person’s professional persona, their online gaming persona, their family persona, or an incognito persona.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A verifiable presentation is created by a holder, can express data from multiple verifiable credentials, and can contain arbitrary additional metadata in forms of additional claims. 
            They are used to present claims to a verifier. 
            It is also possible to present verifiable credential directly.
          </p>

        <h3>Serialization</h3>

        <p>
          In [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]], Verifiable Credentials and Presentations are expressed in JSON [[RFC7519]], more specifically [[JSON-LD11]]. 
          In this serialization, properties of claims are represented as JSON names, and values as JSON objects or literals.
          Subjects of claims are either explicitly identified by an `id` property, or implicitly by appearing as an object with their own JSON name-value pairs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Standard properties defined by [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]] form a distinct set of names, also referred to as a <em>vocabulary</em>.
          And important characteristics of Verifiable Credentials in JSON-LD is that it favors a decentralized and permissionless approach 
          to extend to a new application area through other vocabularies distributed on the Web: anyone can “publish” such a vocabulary, following certain rules described in the <a data-cite="VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0#Extensibility">Extensibility section</a> of the specification.

        <p>
          The following figure is an example for a simple Credential. It states that the person named "Pat", identified by `https://www.exampl.org/persons/pat`, is an alumni of the Example University (identified by `did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1`).
          The Credential is valid from the 1st of January 2010, and is issued by an entity identified by `did:example:2g55q912ec3476eba2l9812ecbfe`.
          Most of the properties in the Credential are from the standard Verifiable Credentials vocabulary, but some terms (like `alumniOf`, `AlumniCredential`) are added by the application-specific vocabulary referred to by `https://www.example.org/vocabs/alumni`.

          The Credential in <a href="#example-credential-example"></a>, issued by Example University, is stored by a holder (possibly the subject of the credential, i.e., John Doe). On request, the holder may “present” a Credential to a verifier, by encapsulating the Credential in a Verifiable Presentation. This is how the result looks like in the JSON-LD serialization:

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Presentation example">
          {
            "@context": [
              "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
              "https://www.example.org/vocabs/alumni"
            ],

            "holder": "did:example:12345678",

            "verifiableCredential": {
              "id": "http://university.example/Credential123",
              "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
              "issuer": "did:example:2g55q912ec3476eba2l9812ecbfe",
              "validFrom": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z",
              "credentialSubject": {
                "id": "https://www.example.org/persons/pat",
                "name": "Pat",
                "alumniOf": {
                  "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
                  "name": "Example University"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        </pre>

        <p>
          Note that the holder could have presented several credentials within the same presentation, or create a new credential by combining others. A Verifiable Presentation is usually short-lived, it is not meant at being stored for a longer period.
